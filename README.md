## Lessons Learned

While doing this project I learned a lot about using 3d models, great animations and transitions with popular libraries. I encountered problems with the 3d model and responsiveness to get the nice waves on the page to line up well but in the end I managed to do well. I also learned how to easily implement dark mode and internationalization. Overall I think this project is a good showcase of me.
